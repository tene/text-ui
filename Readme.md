# text-ui

There is nothing useful or meaningful here yet.  This is just a vague sketch that I'll probably abandon.

text-ui is a rust library for making interactive text-based applications.

My vague aspiration for this project is an abstract high-level API that can be rendered to multiple backends (plain text, unix terminal, windows terminal, gui).

This library is inspired by the [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick) Haskell library.
